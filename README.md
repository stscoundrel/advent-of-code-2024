# Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code 2024, each day in different programming language. Unlikely to finish even half of the days, more of a höntsäthingy.

- Day 01: Dart
- Day 02: Nim
- Day 03: Scala
- Day 04: Java
- Day 05: C#
- Day 06: Kotlin
- Day 07: Rust
- Day 08: Go
- Day 09: Python
- Day 10: TypeScript
- Day 11: C++
- Day 12: JavaScript
- Day 13: Odin

Stopped after Day 13 part 1, as it is exactly the halfway point.
